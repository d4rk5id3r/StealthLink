## 🔥 Stealth-Link
Stealth-link is not a tool for phishing. Instead, it serves as a demonstration of "URL Making Technology," achieved through a straightforward Bash Script. Its purpose is to conceal a phishing URL beneath an innocent-looking URL such as wikipedia.com or facebook.com. It can be included in phishing tools, provided appropriate credit is given, to create a more credible URL appearance.
